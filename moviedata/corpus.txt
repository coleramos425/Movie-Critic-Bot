For a film that is ultimately just the first piece to a much larger narrative, it does not disappoint.
Tarantino surpasses expectations with this stylish and exciting love letter to other classic genres, while leaving his own bloody mark on them. [Full review in Spanish]
A gleefully ultraviolent homage to the B-movie martial arts films of the 1970s. It's pure bloody pulp fiction packed into a tightly wound feature.
The better of the two Kill Bill films, and perhaps the last film where Tarantino created a tight, tense and disciplined exercise in film narrative.
Here was a filmmaker who could have easily stayed in his comfort zone of smart-alecky banter between dudes but instead chose to pare down his dialogue and flex his visual storytelling muscles.
Watching Tarantino's films-and none more than Kill Bill-is like being stuck in a room with someone who, like so many of this director's characters, can't stop talking about the really neat parts in the movies he's seen.
... Kill Bill confirms [Quentin Tarantino] as a filmmaker of astonishing invention and aplomb...
There's nothing like a good 'ole revenge heist (complete with a hit list) to make this film one of Tarantino's best.
The tale is pure pulp, a catalogue of seventies martial arts revenge dramas and American B-movie action thrillers, and the style is pure Tarantino...
delivers on every classic Tarantino brand that you'd come to expect
Visually striking, but also very violent.
A head-spinning dream project of extraordinarily bi-polar, nutso invention, Vol. 1 is a candy store rampage, cheering on Tarantino's fetishes as he built a colorful war machine of ideal double-feature dementia.
Quentin Tarantino's long awaited fourth film finds the pop culture carnivore of filmmaking reinvigorating cinema a second time over with a single-plot-trajectory revenge movie that utilizes samurai sword action with a shifting score of infectious guitar d
With its eclectic use of music and inventive mix of genres, Kill Bill is a striking and enigmatic revenge film visually and culturally rich and relentless in its action.
Something borrowed, something bloody. [Blu-ray]
Tarantino instead relies on delirious, high-octane, imaginative camera work; an anime sequence; and an exhilarating musical soundtrack to punch up a story that loses its intoxicating magnetism well before the final credits roll.
A strange, fun and densely textured work that gets better as it goes along.
Even more gory and adolescent than its models, which explains both the fun and the unpleasantness of this globe-trotting romp.
I didn't leave the cinema aching to see Volume Two (out in February), though I'm interested to learn how things work out.

Kill Bill is a temple of worship -- a devout hymn of praise to crap cinema (which isn't always crappy).
Kill Bill is pretty stupid, but there are also moments of beauty and brilliance.
Unfolding as a book the film is conceived in chapters, each boasting the look and pulse of a specific genre; as expected of Tarantino, there are references to music, literature, fashion, and above all movies and pop culture, both American and foreign.
It's all bang, bang; no kiss, kiss. But this is still bravura film-making from a prodigious talent, and Thurman may yet prove its saving grace.
One of the best films of the year, and, when it's all said and done, probably the decade.
Tarantino is back with his most polished and yet slightly empty effort yet.
A movie that, without Uma, would have ultimately been a stylistic masterpiece, but never the stirring epic that it is shaping up to be.
Perhaps the funniest thing about Kill Bill: Volume One is the realization that this ode to ultraviolence and Uma Thurman's feet is probably Quentin Tarantino's most personal film.
Volume One is, above all, a parade of fantastic fight scenes, each one bloodier than the one that came before ... bloody in the Looney-Toons/Monty-Python sense.
Different enough from Tarantino's previous work to finally win over even an inveterate Tarantino-sceptic like me.

There is no ironic overlay in Tarantino's movies, no 'commenting' on the pop schlock he's replicating. He simply wants to remake in his own way the kinds of movies he's always loved, and he's about as uncynical as a movie geek can be.
Kill Bill isn't human. It's cinema as cinema. Tarantino is like a hyper, too-bright child, worrying you for your attention, jumping from thought to thought in his brain
Blood spews from bodies like fountains of Chinese fireworks throughout the movie.
It may be violent but it also has a joy for life and music and movies.
Volume 1 is a pure sugar-rush, an adrenaline-packed needle that injects wild fun into almost every conceivable vein.
...a gymnastic ballet of violence and a veritable orgy in blood.
Tarantino is no dilettante. He smartly sticks to what he knows, steals from the best, and makes his films his own.
As kung fu films go, this is one of the best I've ever seen.
Tarantino returns to the silver screen with the first installment of a bloody two-part tribute to the samurai stories of old... and we're all better for it!
A bloody, bubble-gum epic with as much dramatic weight as a powder puff.
'Filmmaking genius or blood-loving freak? Tarantino is a bit of both ...'
Brutally bloody and thrillingly callous from first to last.
An audacious, inventive and relentless action movie.
...a movie with such raw ambition and spirit that it literally reinvents the standards of everything it can be associated with.
'Tarantino logra un buen trabajo a secas. Ninguna obra maestra, pero si una buena cinta para pasar el rato y reírse de las exageraciones mostradas'
Confesso que ri ao perceber que daria 5 estrelas para este longa - mas qualquer outra cotação seria injusta e preconceituosa.
It's all about energy. It's constant and, for me, addicting.
If genre imitation is at epidemic levels, Tarantino still holds the title of original master, and the guy most likely to be stolen from.
[Tarentino]'s back in high style, drawing on such sources as martial arts movies and Japanese animation to create a vivid world all his own.
Quentin Tarantino makes terrible movies really, really well.
(...) una fiesta, una orgía de sangre, humor y locura desmedida, excesiva y caprichosa, seguramente no del gusto de todos.
But if Kill Bill: Volume 1 is the creation of a director with a lot to show, it's also the work of one with not very much to say.
Kill Bill, Volume 1 is Quentin Tarantino's amazing fourth film and the first chapter of a tantalizing homage to 1970s action and blaxploitation.
Tarantino has constructed a highly artificial screen world in which to unfold his funky baroque bloodbath.
Really, it seemed to me that Tarantino was merely trying to shock people into forgetting the idiocracy of what was happening on screen.
Divided we fall. What "Kill Bill Vol. 1" loses in plot, tension, and character development it (almost) makes up for in terms of sheer unadulterated style.
Quentin Tarantino, Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu take us to the edge of taste, over the cliffs of gore, and right into pop culture sublime.
Simply beautiful to look at and listen to.
An impressive exercise in style but little more.
If you can't stand violence in movies, please don't even read this review.
As wacky action-adventure movies go, this is a good film. But it's the type of work that more than a dozen Hollywood filmmakers could have turned out in less time than it took [director Quentin] Tarantino.
Six years and this is all that Quentin Tarantino can come up with?
There is more cinematic thrill per minute up on the screen here than I've seen in a very long time.
It's impossible to tell whether all of this adds up to anything. The piles and piles of allusions... certainly enrichens the texture of the film, and to his credit, Tarantino manages to agglomerate these styles into a unique cinematic voice.

Tarantino throws every trick he knows at the screen, including an animated sequence, in an effort to make a pure B-movie. He's succeeded.
A psychotically enjoyable murderous massacre of epic proportions.
One of the great gorefests of cinematic history.
Takes Tarantino's trademark brand of excessive violence in an over-the-top direction that mimics the fun but cheesy kung fu revenge films of yesteryear.
It is the distilled essence of everything that kicks a** about the extravagantly violent genres of Kung fu, Samurai, and Anime
An indulgent, outlandish, and thoroughly entertaining ballet of blood.
Hell hath no fury like a Tarantino heroine scorned.
Quentin Tarantino's most wild-*** effort yet.
After nearly two hours of bloodshed (no matter how artfully presented), Tarantino owes us a little more than a "to be continued . . ." tease.
Ripping off and rearranging moves, ideas, and codes from seemingly countless sources, Kill Bill is a careful film that looks glib, a nuanced film that looks shallow.
Has all the coolness and daring and wit through which Tarantino made his name. It delivers what we expected, and packs some shocking punches on top.
I would argue that, in a bizarre way, Mr. Tarantino empowers women as no action-genre director before him ever has.
Visually inventive, strangely beautiful and poetic, in a bare-bones, samurai-warrior way. A movie that, while dealing with death, is joyfully alive with surprises.
Quentin Tarantino is a joyous filmmaker, one whose love of film is clear in every frame of Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and one whose euphoria is absolutely infectious.
Uma Thurman's performance breaks down the emotional barriers that often keep an audience at a distance.
Tarantino is totally in charge at every second. He knows exactly what he's doing, exactly what he wants to convey from moment to moment.
Cinematically exhilerating... This is the most elated action filmmaking I've seen in ages.
It may not be great, but it is if not true filmmaking, very, very true movie making.
When people tell you it's bloody, they're not exaggerating. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot more. (And I loved Pulp Fiction)
I can't wait for Volume 2.
A giddy, gory, beautifully mounted trash spectacle ... at least so far.
Glorious cinematic pulp.
Kill Bill Vol. 1 is one entertaining and stylish thrill ride, no more, no less.
A hyper-violent, hyper-gory, kung-fu grindhouse flick. And there's nothing at all wrong with that.
A brash, bloody and simply exhilarating revenge melodrama and stylistic indulgence inspired by an imagination that spent thousands of hours absorbing pulp paperbacks, comic books, 'Kung Fu,' the mythology of Bruce Lee and Hong Kong chop-socky epics while
A movie of confident, professional showmanship; it uses the screen as a conduit to directly transfer the enthusiasm its creator feels to the audience, delivering giddy energy.
Despite all the cinematic tricks employed in this film, it ends up being a just another action film at heart. As such, it is good, but not among the best of the genre.
This is one dangerously fun and ridiculously well made samurai homage meets pop culture pastiche that you'll kill yourself for missing if you even dare try.
Despite the (for some) outrageous amount of violence, Tarantino manages to stage these fight scenes with panache, opting for a tongue-in-cheek tone that elicits more chuckles than gasps of horror.
The end result: a reckless and rollicking gem that purposely swims in its inane and preposterous frivolity...this high-powered assault of fast-paced foolishness is infectious
It's recommended for fighting enthusiasts and die-hard film-buffs who will appreciate the audacious allusions.
If Tarantino's previous films had one foot set in the real world and one in the realm of pulp fiction, this pop culture fever dream represents blissful surrender to unreality...
Tarantino the Genius is long gone; we'll have to settle for Tarantino the Fairly Interesting.
Tarantino combines babes, steel, revenge and cinematic artistry into something elemental.
One of the greatest action escapist films ever made by a nerd.
Killer thriller.
Do I feel cheated by having to buy another movie ticket to see how 'Kill Bill' ends? You betcha.
Kill Bill is trash made beautiful, sometimes extraordinarily so.
Simultaneously a spectacular act of movie-making and a slight movie.
The chocolate eclair of fall films: a delicious, yet empty treat.
Kill Bill is an entirely problematic film. On one hand it's a very difficult to recommend ... But on the other hand I could never warn people away from Kill Bill Vol 1.
So palpably exciting you'll want to watch it again immediately after the first viewing.
Even half of a Tarantino film is twice as good as any thriller we've seen all year.
Tarantino's fusion of action genres may result in a new sub-genre: the adult comic book adventure.
And even if the film is a bloody, violent mess that borders on incoherence, it's still a brilliant, bloody mess that energizes the spirit like few pictures can.
It all adds up to an epic pop artefact of indescribable soullessness.
Kill Bill is one long yakkety-yak about Tarantino's passions. He's the samurai who won't shut up.
Kill Bill: Volume One falters by placing Tarantino's cracker-jack dialogue in the back seat and placing style in front. But the killer story and Thurman's performance leaves the audience begging for Volume Two
A marvel of strikingly original action setpieces and tight plotting, surrounded by a visual lyricism difficult to translate into words.
Tarantino wants you to have a good time, and he'd be the first to admit that it isn't Citizen Kane.
Does not come within a thousand miles of Pulp Fiction for philosophy, story and character development, but for style it blows every other movie this year out of the water.
Delivered with such high panache and brio, it's mesmerizing.
Has matched, if not eclipsed, the power and scope of 1994's Pulp Fiction.
Whatever Bill's limitations, style isn't one of them.
If your sensibilities are in line with Tarantino's, the result is sheer sleaze Nirvana.
Not only is this the work of a major and vital talent in full bloom, it's the most thrillingly entertaining American movie so far this year.
This is some glorious filth -- in the most flattering, arterial-spraying sense of filth.
With no real characters or ideas in sight, it seemed ultimately tiresome and forgettable.
It boggles the mind that after six years of silence, all Tarantino has to offer is this garbage.
The film is a caravan of Tarantino enthusiasms, from Hong Kong quickies to film noir to Kurosawa's joyous Hidden Fortress.
The biggest, baddest B-movie ever made.
An awesome explosion of visceral energy.
It took Tarantino six years to come up with this?
For the first time, Tarantino has made a film that validates almost every charge his detractors have leveled against him.
Kill Bill would be the easiest thing in the world to dismiss if it weren't so much nasty fun.
A diverting but sanitized space-saver.
QT's back and damn if the wait wasn't well worth it. Get ready for oodles of violence and swashbucklung humor!
An eye-popping, blood-soaked, ingeniously choreographed thriller and Hong Kong homage that ultimately adds up to ... not much.
A tribute both scrupulously authentic and wildly original.
A maddeningly uneven spaghetti Eastern that's well worth seeing for his technical mastery, even as it challenges you with the geeky auteur's boundless self-indulgence.
There's a lot to admire in Kill Bill, and a lot that should have been lopped off like the arms and legs and scalps that go flying.
Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is self-indulgent, overwrought, shallow and ridiculous. It is also brilliant, a blast of cinematic lunacy and as much of a guilty pleasure as the schlocky movies Tarantino adores.
Content? Not important. Here delivery is everything, and Tarantino delivers like a man born with film developer pumping through his veins.
With Kill Bill, the film geek has made a movie for other film geeks, students of film and critics.
A brilliant tour de force of trash cinema.
Despite a draggy section and a problem with proportion, Kill Bill bristles with such vitality it hardly matters that -- at least at the halfway point -- it feels inconsequential.
Kill Bill may be mindless fun, but it is the most mindless fun in memory.
An adrenaline-fueled thrill ride that will satisfy even the most carnage-crazed action fan.
An action movie with fantastic music, considerable style and the mentality of a director refusing to leave the sanctuary in his 1970s childhood.
The violence, blood levels -- and just plain cheesy gore -- in this film are extreme, but Tarantino's sharp dialogue and expert editing leaves you breathless.
A bloated, simplistic, cartoonishly violent film.
A feverish, exhilarating collision of '70s film genres.
...an epic of influences.
The year's most important unimportant movie.
It's worth paying for if it's what you're into; otherwise any neophytes will probably feel a little turned off.
Tarantino's filmmaking prowess has been honed like one of Sonny Chiba's blades and...his homage to chop socky goodness is flawless.
Quentin Tarantino is back - with a vengeance!
Kill Bill takes a cue from Spaghetti Western master Sergio Leone and turns every little twist and turn into a giant-sized operatic odyssey.
Just as only NBA fanatics can justify watching the first three quarters of a game, only Tarantino fanatics will be satisfied with the first installment of Kill Bill.
With an ounce of restraint, Tarantino could've had a masterpiece on his hands.
Uma and her foes were once on the same side. They were the "Deadly Viper Assassination Squad," or D.I.V.A.S. In a fit of me-too inspiration, the powers-that-be over at the Playboy mansion formed their own death squad: "Women Hefner Owns Rarely Enjoy Se
A wondrous ode to the joie de vivre of filmmaking, paying homage to great '60s and '70s action flicks from around the globe.
Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a great film

For dangerously fun kung-fu action, Bill's the man.
Kill Bill ranks just behind Pulp Fiction in terms of strutting the director's storytelling gifts.
A movie that will separate the true cinema lovers from ... well, just about everyone who has another set of values.
Kill Bill is about nothing more (or less) than its director's passion for the mindless action pictures that got him through adolescence.
A gift for action fans.
If you're one of those movie fans who are looking for a great big smorgasbord of vengeance, Kill Bill will shred resistance.
Kill Bill: Volume 1 shows Quentin Tarantino so effortlessly and brilliantly in command of his technique that he reminds me of a virtuoso violinist racing through Flight of the Bumble Bee ...
Vol. 1 is a shot of pure adrenalin on celluloid, headed for the heart and the gut, not the head.
Quentin Tarantino comes out of the box with a vengeance, intent on the idea of parlaying hardcore grind-house into trendy art-house.
Celluloid maestro Quentin Tarantino returns with a limb-hacking, blood-spewing, epic tale of revenge that utilizes every cinematic trick in his formidable arsenal.
Doesn't stack up to Tarantino's earlier works, because they actually have a story, but it's still pretty entertaining stuff if you're into funny, sick, classic movie violence.
Busby Berkeley would be proud of its choreography and imagination, as would Roger Corman for the splatter fest
A flick so knee-deep in its own genre-worship that it should thrill movie fans the world over while giving the action junkies a few extended sequences that they'll want to watch again and again.
Tarantino is like a bull in a video shop, knocking over shelves and letting the genres fall where they may.
But perhaps the film's greatest achievement is not its celebration of cult film, but the fact that Tarantino has apparently found the street cred he's been searching for as he doesn't use the N-word even once.
Ectomorph goddess Uma Thurman gives a dazzling performance. The stars have the acting and action chops to more than hold their own in fight scenes with eye-popping visuals that would overwhelm most performers.
While the picture oozes style (and blood), it comes up short on substance - which is what has always set Tarantino's grindhouse homages head and shoulders above the pulp pictures that inform them.
Like the first time you saw "Pulp Fiction" at the theatre, you walk out not quite sure what to think...but one thing you do know is that you loved it, and you'll definitely be coming back for more
A whole lot of movie, more than what your average 5 or 6 flicks deliver.
Embarrassingly masturbatory...
Tarantino's talent rests with the ability to click into the viewer's movie-going experience like a TV remote and rekindle memories of earlier film favorites.
With Kill Bill, Tarantino has belatedly made the self-indulgent mess many expected from him years ago.
Quentin Tarantino goes forward to the past -- and reclaims the cinematic style that he defined.
This is the only episodic film that actually leaves you wanting more. The final revelation makes you re-evaluate the entire journey, which is what a good cliffhanger should do.
Kill Bill is an electrifying invocation of the mysterious cathartic power of the lowdown genre potboiler.
A film that tells an essentially simple story in such a wonderfully flashy fashion and Tarantino's intoxication with the joys of movie magic, like Francis Coppola's, is so giddy and contagious that the audience becomes as excited with watching it as he cl
By god, this could have been great. Spectacular. A masterpiece. If only Quentin had decided to make an epic rather than an epic joke.
Maybe when Tarantino 'Godfather sagas-it' God knows when, Kill Bill will be the masterpiece we hope it is and he surely believes it to be
Even when geysers of gore are erupting onscreen, Tarantino finds a strange kind of grace amidst the chaos. He's cherishing every carefully calculated second of this experience and he wants to share the joy with his viewers.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!!!!!
While Hollywood was catching up with Hong Kong, Tarantino was studying Japanese pulp fiction
Structurally and narratively amputated, Volume 1 retains head and guts but loses its heart and gams to the second installment.
An exercise in style.
Meticulously structured, self-referential and kinetic, Kill Bill is as impeccably crafted as a graphic Amelie.
For the first time in Tarantino's filmmaking career, the written story -- both in word and development -- proves the least interesting part of the whole equation.
A feast of bravura filmmaking, thoroughly engaging and unique in even its most derivative elements.
A smorgasbord of slam-bang mayhem, certain to tantalize young men, and with its ultratough heroine, perhaps young women, too.
The most gorgeous B-movie ever made.
Kill Bill not only lives up to the hype, it exceeds it, with some of the most amazing fight sequences ever filmed.
In the wake of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the Matrix series, even the recent So Close, Tarantino's movie comes off as been there, kicked that.
A rampaging hurricane of a chop socky revenge flick.
Tarantino pays tribute to so many other films, you'd need a doctorate in cinema with a minor in pop culture references to catch it all.
If the second volume is anything like this one, Miramax might want to consider changing its name to Overkill Bill.
Reckless? Perhaps. Indulgent? Sure. But it's never boring.
This is the movie we've been waiting for from Quentin Tarantino, it combines everything he loves about movies and what he does best.
One of the most intense, violent and breathtaking American epics ever filmed.
This is Tarantino the ultimate movie geek, channeling all the best tee-hee-GROSS! moments from Hong Kong and Japanese splatter movies.
In Kill Bill, Tarantino brings delicious sin back to movies -- the thrill you get from something down, dirty and dangerous.
Although the towering Thurman is usually treated as something of an eroticized force of nature, her sly, angry, heartfelt performance here brings humanity to an otherwise shallow tale that risks being all blood and no passion.
One of this year's most entertaining flicks.
It may be nothing but style without substance--but what style! And it certainly beats the vast majority of pictures, which offer neither.
[T]he cinematic equivalent of karaoke or bad photocopies, mindlessly adopting style while forgetting the basic precepts of storytelling.
In Kill Bill, the allusions are the text rather than the subtext, and the movie never quite develops a life of its own.
...Most certainly based more on old movies than on life itself - unabashedly so, gloriously so, entertainingly so....This is simply a great "movie movie."
Kill Bill Vol. 1 is contemporary Tarantino out Tarantino-ing classic Tarantino.
This is one killer kick-*** of a movie!
Kill Bill: Volume 1 is essentially a pop culture wanker's failed multimedia experiment, a vacuous junk heap of dorky gags and riffs, violent anime and offensive slapstick.
Kill Bill may have little on its mind besides pop extravagance, yet you can feel the movie tracing a transition in the world -- from West to East, from male to female rule.
Fun and smart, but undeniably thin.
See the film if you love the movies--it's the old iron for a new day.
The dialogue is as sharp as the swords used to slice off the mountains of body parts.
Half-a-movie at full-price -- it's annoyingly unsatisfying. Also self-indulgent, sadistic, juvenile, pretty to look at, and empty as a beer can on my front porch.
It lacks the trademark snappy dialogue but delivers fantastic fight scenes, a cool soundtrack and a dizzying array of cinematic tricks.
As a whole, Kill Bill might be an entertaining product, but, after seeing Volume 1, I was insulted.
Guaranteed to blow you away.
... inventive, exciting, ballsy, violent, entertaining, stylized and brilliant.
A barely watchable mess, a tangled montage of fashion gloss streaked in gore, a cocktail party in an abattoir.
Kill Bill is, at long last, the revolution Pulp Fiction fans hoped Jackie Brown was going to be ... leaves the stomach turning, the tongue lolling and the mind reeling.
This isn't just the movie you've been waiting for from Quentin Tarantino. This is the movie you've been waiting for, period.
Awesome! Breathtaking! Tarantino shows off his libido and his id.
This is the ultimate movie for kung-fu drive-in geeks ...
Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is Quentin Tarantino set on '11.'
The characters are vivid enough to rise above [Tarantino's] cinematic nerdiness. Thurman is shockingly good.
The film is hugely watchable.
Picture Monty Python's Black Knight sketch spread over the course of an entire movie.
Weinstein seems to be letting Tarantino have his way with a double release, turning one potentially great film into two flashy mediocrities.
A blood-stained love letter to exploitation movies that seems to be missing a few pages.
